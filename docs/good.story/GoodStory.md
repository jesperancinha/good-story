# Good Story by Jo√£o Esperancinha TL;DR

NOTE: The story at the bottom does not describe actual real events, but it is inspired by personal experiences. All
characters described are fictional characters. The story itself is also pure fiction.

## Synopsis

This story finds its inspiration on my own personal life. The story revolves around Lucy, a young woman who seeks a meaning in her life, still carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders, but still with a vigorous heart-beat that reminds her that she's not done yet. Life still has a lot to offer
Lucy.
The story is told in a metaphoric fashion with imaginary deities and characters. It encompasses the materialization of feelings and how they can manifest.

## Chapter I - Escaping the Beast

Lucy, was a young woman in her thirties who came to live on a remote island on the coast of Portugal after being diagnosed with a neurological unknown disability. It caused her not to move well, not to coordinate her arms well and this made her eligible to ask for an abrupt early retirement. At the
same time, all her relatives past way, and she inherited a fortune. Lucy was alone in the world, and she didn't have any friends. In her house, on this island, she spent her days figuring out what further meaning could she give to live. In her home country, The Netherlands, there was no one
available to help her or to keep her company. Her family wasn't there anymore and for unknown reasons, she had made almost no friends in her life. She would visit main land Portugal to get groceries, but just for that. Her illness seemed to block her, from achieving her goals. Any goal would feel
impossible to
achieve. Lucy was alone. She could live, eat, sleep, wash, stare and enjoy the small pleasures of life, but further she had nothing. During the summer months, Lucy could find some sort of happiness under the sun, the warm weather, a stroll at the beach or just looking at the movements of the small
sea animals that would reach the shore.

One day, during September, the clouds had fallen into the ground and the air was foggy, denser than usual, and it was hard to see. Lucy still wanted to go to the beach. It was almost lunchtime and Lucy still had to cook lunch. She was about to turn back home, when she saw a moving shadow in the
horizon. It seemed to be approaching shore. Given the unusual shape of it, Lucy was intrigued, and she waited...

The shape seemed to blend in, move, and split itself everywhere around the horizon. Like a dark cloud moving between lighter ones.
Sometimes it seemed like showing off the shape of a house, a chair, a bat, a boat, a hammer, a coin...
Afar, the shape seemed to whisper sounds of the wind, but also words. They seemed to be spoken in her native language, Dutch and they seemed to say in a loop:   

<b>Beast</b> - "Ik geloof niet dat je dat kan","Ik geloof niet dat je dat kan","Ik geloof niet dat je dat kan"...

It kept going louder and louder until Lucy screamed as loud as she could. The whole sky then became the same dark colour, and it started to rain. Lucy ran back into her house.
As it kept on raining, Lucy questioned what she just had experienced. The looping sentence means "I do not believe that you can do that". The voice and the sentence reminded her of something familiar, but she couldn't recall exactly what it was.

It was getting late and Lucy wanted to go through photos she had kept with her of her long-lost days of her Life in the Netherlands. It was unusual for her to experience such a vivid experience, as if some force reminded her of something to do. Something she never achieved but always had the chance to. And that chance was not gone yet.   

Flipping through her photos, Lucy came across an old photo of her colleagues where she used to work. This was a big retail store called `Blue Round Grachten Roses Dot Com`, known as `BeRGees` in street language. They sold practically anything online and Lucy worked there as a Technical Support assistance. This was almost 10 years ago.
Back then Lucy had dreams and believed in a better future. Everything seemed to smile to her, and she had amazing successes. As she was looking deeply in the foto, a woman in the front stood out. Lucy knew who she was.
Her name was Hara Arre.
